  At PagerDuty, we have a tradition of going out on a "Last Lecture". I think
  PagerDuty has given me more than enough chances to speak over the past 7 years
  so instead I took it as a chance to share some of the best advice I've gotten
  from my coworkers. The best pieces came from multiple directions so I've left
  them all unsourced.

**"The audience wants you to succeed." **That's the advice that helped me stop dreading public speaking and it's held true outside of a few charmingly hostile sales calls. Of course they also want me to "**Speak slower**" and believe me, I'm trying. A couple of you have gotten a giggle out of how many times I repeat this in my speaker notes (or write it on my hands). Say a quarter as much, say it half as fast, build context and listen more. Practice more, repeat.

"**Overcommunicate**" but remember that context is easily lost and positivity gets destroyed over email. In writing "**Something positive sounds neutral, something neutral sounds negative and something negative sounds awful**." One strategy I've found works for me is to write the email, and then go meet/call the person instead. It goes both ways too - assume positive intent whenever you get a poorly worded email that sounds like a personal attack :)

**"Hire people who are better than you.**" Early on I had a front row seat to some poorly considered hires and tweaked our hiring process to try to avoid that (if you've been blocked from giving a 3 in an interview loop - that's me). But like most hiring managers & interviewers, I was overthinking how to avoid making mistakes, not how we hire the best people. Now I still ask all candidates the same questions for calibration, but I'm always looking to understand your superpower. The single thing I'm proudest of over the past 7 years is the sheer number of people I've helped to bring onboard who completely eclipse me in some skill. Hiring great people makes it a lot easier to "Give away your legos".

The first one I wrote down was to "**Act everyday like you're running for mayor of the office**"  --  and honestly it's probably been the hardest advice to act on. My natural happy place looks more like writing a SQL query with a scowl on my face than sitting on a culture panel for new employees. But it's good advice. This company and every other story you'll be a part of is made of people - never be afraid to say hello, add someone to LinkedIn, and never keep a compliment to yourself.

**"Everyone is the hero of their own narrative"** and every interaction you have is going to be framed by their internal monologue more than anything you could say. Command of the Message training does a good job of explaining this, so does How to Talk So Kids Will Listen. When I started, I assumed that us all being on the same team would be enough to build a rapport automatically - it doesn't. I also assumed that people knew when they had knocked something out of the park - they don't. It's mind blowing how often bar-raisers end up beating themselves up over something they did a great job on. Tell them.

"**Yup. Stuff's hard.**" I'll never stop looking for better ways to do things. But sometimes there just isn't an easy way, you have to do the legwork. When I moved here from Canada, I assumed that these nerfgun wielding goofballs in the corner of a greeting card company (our actual office when I joined) wouldn't make it and I'd be out of a job - but they did we did and now we are worth more than a billion dollars. We add more ARR in a week than I thought we'd ever get to - and I'm scared to leave that. But "**If it doesn't scare you, don't do it.**"

Don't be a stranger. You'll see me again. It's been an honour working with all of you.
